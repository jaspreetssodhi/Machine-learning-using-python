"Thank god my cousin told me give it a watch. It's been a week since I saw this movie and I just can't stop thinking about the movie and the characters. This is my second perfect 10 I've ever given to any movie (first one was Scarface). Ammy Virk is the dark horse of the Punjabi industry (what a natural actor!! ) and the innocence portrayed by Sargun is just fantastic. I don't usually see a lot of Punjabi movies but by far this is the best one I've seen moreover I think I'd be wrong if I restrict this movie for a regional movie. I think this movie should be dubbed in every language and should be shown everywhere in the world. Kudos to the actors and directors and the whole crew for coming up with such an amazing project!
